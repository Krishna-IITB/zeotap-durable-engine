Prompts Used for Zeotap Durable Engine Assignment
===================================================

Author: Krishna (IIT Bombay)

Key questions I used AI tools for while building the engine:

1. "Basic architecture for durable workflow engine in Go" - Gemini
2. "Implement generic step function in Go 1.21" - ChatGPT
3. "SQLite setup and JSON serialization in Go" - Perplexity
4. "Concurrent database writes handling in Go" - GitHub Copilot
5. "Unique step IDs for loops using atomic counter" - ChatGPT
6. "Employee onboarding workflow with parallel steps" - Gemini
7. "Simulate process crash with Ctrl+C in Go" - Perplexity
8. "Testing memoization - verify skip on restart" - GitHub Copilot
9. "sqlite3 commands for database inspection" - ChatGPT
10. "Professional README structure" - Gemini

Tools used:
- Gemini: Architecture and design patterns
- ChatGPT: Go syntax and implementation details  
- Perplexity: Best practices and debugging
- GitHub Copilot: Code completion and suggestions

Note: AI tools were used for guidance on syntax, best practices, and concept clarification. All design decisions, code implementation, testing, and debugging were done manually.
